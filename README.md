# Boston Housing Price Prediction

A comprehensive data science and machine learning project for predicting housing prices in the Boston area using data analysis, visualization, and regression modeling techniques. This is a final project for DSEM (Data Science and Machine Learning) course.

## üìã Project Overview

This project focuses on **data analysis and visualization** for the Boston Housing Prediction dataset, implementing predictive modeling to forecast median home values in Boston neighborhoods. The project demonstrates the complete data science pipeline from exploratory data analysis to model evaluation using various regression techniques including Linear Regression and Random Forest.

**Primary Objective**: Predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (`MEDV`) in Boston neighborhoods using socioeconomic, environmental, and infrastructure characteristics.

**Key Applications**: The dataset illustrates the connection between housing costs and elements like infrastructure, education, and air quality, making it valuable for regression modeling, exploratory data analysis, and urban planning.

## üéØ Problem Statement

This project addresses the challenge of predicting housing prices in Boston neighborhoods by analyzing the relationship between various socioeconomic, environmental, and infrastructure factors and median home values. The dataset presents several analytical challenges including:

- **Multicollinearity** between features requiring careful preprocessing
- **Capped target variable** necessitating appropriate modeling techniques  
- **Complex relationships** between housing costs and factors like infrastructure, education, and air quality
- **Need for careful preprocessing** including scaling and outlier treatment

The goal is to build predictive models that can accurately forecast median home values using available neighborhood characteristics.

## üìä Dataset Information

The project uses the **Boston Housing Dataset** from the 1978 study "Hedonic Prices and the Demand for Clean Air," sourced from the Carnegie Mellon University Statistics Library (https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets).

- **NOX**: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- **DIS**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

### Important Features
Based on feature importance analysis, the most significant predictors of housing prices include:
- **RM** (Average number of rooms): Strong positive correlation
- **LSTAT** (Lower status population %): Strong negative correlation
- **PTRATIO** (Pupil-teacher ratio): Moderate negative correlation
- **NOX** (Nitric oxides concentration): Environmental factor impact

### Business Insights
